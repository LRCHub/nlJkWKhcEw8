I don't wanna spend another lonely night
Oooooooooo
I got the lights turned up
The door is locked
The bedroom TV's on
Doing the only thing that gets me through the night
Since you've been gone
Prayin' for daylight
Waiting for that morning sun
So i can act like my whole life ain't going wrong
Baby come back to me, I swear i'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight
(Prayin' for daylight)

I made a bad miscalculation
Betting you would never leave
Cause if you're gettting on with your new life
Then where does that leave me

Prayin' for daylight
Waiting for that morning sun
So i can act like my whole life ain't going wrong
Baby come back to me, I swear i'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight
(Prayin' for daylight)

Prayin' for daylight
(Prayin' for daylight)

Prayin' for daylight
Hoping that i didn't wait too long
(I didn't wait too long)
That this is just the dark before the dawn

Deep in my heart i know
That you love me as much as i llove you
And that you must be lying somewhere
Looking up to heaven too

Prayin' for daylight
Waiting for that morning sun
So i can act like my whole life ain't going wrong
Baby come back to me, I swear i'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight
(Prayin' for daylight)

Prayin' for daylight
Waiting for that morning sun
So i can act like my whole life ain't going wrong
Baby come back to me, I swear i'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight
(Prayin' for daylight)

Prayin' for daylight
I dont' wanna spend another lonely night
I dont' wanna spend another lonely night
(Prayin' for daylight)
Prayin' for daylight
I don't wanna spend another lonely night
Oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo
Prayin' for daylight
