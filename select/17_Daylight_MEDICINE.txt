To my surprise and my delight
I saw sunrise, Isaw sunlight
I am nothing in the dark
And the clouds burst to show daylight
Oh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this heart of mine
Oh and I realize
Who cannot live without
Oh come apart without
It
On a hhilltopon a sky-rise
Like a first born child
And at full tilt and in full flight
Defeat ddarkness, breaking daylight
Oh and the sun will shine
Yeah on this heart of mine
Oh and I realized
Who cannot live without
Oh and come apart without
Daylight
(Slowly breaking through daylight)
End
