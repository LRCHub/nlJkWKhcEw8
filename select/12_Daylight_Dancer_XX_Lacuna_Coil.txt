Answer me, it can't be so hard
You cry to relieve what's in your heart
Desolation, grief and agony
Try to move down in this grave
Try to believe in every faith
As another bridge to clarity

Want to stay another way
Want to stay another way

Take another chance to find a distant sanity
Take a chance to turn your pain in truth
To fight a different enemy

Dance with me, it can't be so hard
Time to reveal what's in your heart
Desolation, grief and agony
Walking through a life decayed
While you're repeating your mistakes
There's another chance to try to get away

Take another chance to find a distant sanity
Take a chance to turn your pain in truth
To fight a different enemy

Want to stay another way
Want to stay another way

Take another chance to find a distant sanity
Take a chance to turn your pain in truth
To fight a different enemy

To fight a different enemy!
